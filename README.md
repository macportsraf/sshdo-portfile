My version of my sshdo macports Portfile.

It differs from the official Portfile in that it uses whatever python or
python3 is already available, rather than requiring a port of a particular
version of python that requires it to be updated every year or so. And it
includes all four download sites, rather than just one.

Actually, there is still no official Portfile for sshdo. It's been waiting
months to be merged. Perhaps it never will be.
